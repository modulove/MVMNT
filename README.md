# MVMNT
Bezier Curves Smooth Random Control Voltage (CV)

This is our adaption of the original [HAGIWO 58th original eurorack modular synth DIY project the Bezier curve random CV generator](https://note.com/solder_state/n/n39aacefd73a3) and the [HAGIWO #12 SYNC LFO](https://note.com/solder_state/n/n4c600f2431c3).

The Story of "MVMNT":

The journey began with the publication of the original design by Hagiwo in October 2022, the hardware is heavily based on Michael ZÃ¼lch's ([Cats-Synth](https://github.com/mzuelch/CATs-Eurosynth)) LFO, with invaluable contributions from the vibrant eurorack modular community. 
It is inspired by the CV section of Mutable Instruments Marbles and we aimed to make it SYNTH DIY friendly and accessible to beginners as well as enthusiasts alike.
