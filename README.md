Unlock the magic of modular synthesis with "MVMNT," an extraordinary module designed to infuse your soundscapes with vitality and dynamic expression. 

This is our adaption of the original [HAGIWO 58th original eurorack modular synth DIY project the Bezier curve random CV generator](https://note.com/solder_state/n/n39aacefd73a3) and the [HAGIWO #12 SYNC LFO](https://note.com/solder_state/n/n4c600f2431c3).

The Story of "MVMNT":

The journey began with the publication of the original design by Hagiwo in October 2022, the hardware is heavily based on Michael Zülch's ([Cats-Synth](https://github.com/mzuelch/CATs-Eurosynth)) LFO, with invaluable contributions from the vibrant eurorack modular community. 
It is inspired by the CV section of Mutable Instruments Marbles and we aimed to make it SYNTH DIY friendly and accessible to beginners as well as enthusiasts alike.

# Key Features:

- Dual-Panel Design by [bkrsmdesign](https://www.instagram.com/bkrsmdesign/ "Sasha Kruse"):
  "MVMNT" comes with a unique flip panel, featuring the original SYNC MOD LFO on the backside. This dual-use design allows you to switch between the two panels, providing flexibility and added value.
- Three Options in One: Choose the path that suits you best with three options - a complete built module for immediate gratification, a complete DIY kit, or a panel/PCB kit with pre-placed SMD components for the perfect entry point into SYNTH DIY.
- Beginner-Friendly: We've made it accessible to beginners by keeping assembly straightforward. With just 20 parts to assemble, "MVMNT" welcomes newcomers to the world of modular synths. Our build video and firmware uploader ensure a smooth journey for all skill levels.
- Smooth Random Control Voltage (CV): "MVMNT" introduces the power of smooth random CV, enhancing your modular with dynamic and unpredictable modulation possibilities. Say goodbye to static soundscapes and welcome the beauty of randomness.
- Versatile Firmware Options: Collaborating with the talented coder Adam Wonak, "MVMNT" offers a wide range of additional firmware options to try:

 - Bezier Curve Smooth Random Control (Default): The core feature that unlocks smooth, enigmatic control voltage for dynamic modulation.
 - SYNC LFO ...
 - ADSR - envelope generator firmware: Craft intricate envelope shapes to shape your sound with precision.
 - Baby4 - 4 step cv sequencer firmware: Dive into the world of CV sequencing.
 - Multi-mode Envelope Generator firmware: 
 - Generative Polyrhythms based on 16 step counter knobs.
 - Generative CV Sequencer inspired by the Deja Vu mode of the Mutable Instruments Marbles

# Knob Functions:

1. Level Knob: Set the CV voltage range. Define the maximum value within the 0 to 5V range for precise control over your sound.

2. Curve Knob: Modify the curvature of the voltage change curve. At 0, the change is linear, while higher values introduce greater curvature, conforming to the Bezier curve.

3. σ (Standard Deviation) Knob: Control the width of fluctuation of frequency. At 0, voltage changes at a constant frequency. Increasing the value intensifies the fluctuation, introducing an element of unpredictability to your sound.

4. Frequency Knob: Adjust the frequency of voltage change, allowing you to control the speed of modulation.


# MVMNT experience

This module beame a essential companion to breathe life into our modular patches. In a world where static sound can stifle creativity, "MVMNT" offers the automation and randomness we need to focus on composition and exploration.
